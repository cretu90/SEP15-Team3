 * Sets up a fixed number of connections to the database, stores them and

 * case of occuring errors it exceutes last statements and closes the
 * connections to leave the database in a valid state.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The DatabaseConnectionManager represents the pool, in which the connections
 * are hold. If a thread requests for a connection and there is a free
 * connections, the DatabaseConnectionManager gives it to him. If there's no
 * free connection at the time, the thread has to wait and the
 * DatabaseConnectionManager notifies the waiting thread as soon as there is a
 * free one.
 * 
 * <p>
 * In case of a JVM crash, the DatabaseConnectionManager excetues last
 * statements and closes all connections to the database with the regard to
 * leave the database in a valid state and not to occupy resources.
